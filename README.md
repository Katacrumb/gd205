This is the first attempt at some basic movement (up,down,left,right)
the camera is always positioned at the very top of the character.
falling platforms were added to this, but may need tweaking.
in the next one I hope to add:

 - enemies
 - loading a new scene
 - end goal

I added some invisible walls so the player doesnt spam outside to get around the floor. quickfix for a bug lol
I also added code to change the direction of the object and a texture to signify which direction you are moving.
in the next one I hope to add:

 - enemies
 - loading a new scene
 - end goal

I was able to add a scene loader for when the player progresses to the next level!!! 
a lowercase P was the reason it hadnt worked but now it does.... 

next on the list:
-Enemies
-a timer?

*i dont really have a game idea for this one*

added sound ! the audio is a little iffy but its whatevs aslong as it sounds ok. 
I fixed the enemy, im gonna try and make them move tomorrow, i just needed to use the reload scene code, i had to seperate it from the floor code due to me wanting to add sound. Prefabed it so i can use it anywhere! 
things to do 
- Sleep
- add more sounds 
- make a end level with moving enemies 
- maybe make the lighting better.
