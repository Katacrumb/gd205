# gd205
unity project for gd205

This is the first attempt at some basic movement (up,down,left,right)
the camera is always positioned at the very top of the character.
falling platforms were added to this, but may need tweaking.
in the next one I hope to add:

 - enemies
 - loading a new scene
 - end goal

I added some invisible walls so the player doesnt spam outside to get around the floor. quickfix for a bug lol
I also added code to change the direction of the object and a texture to signify which direction you are moving.
in the next one I hope to add:

 - enemies
 - loading a new scene
 - end goal
